      <h1>What exactly is this website?</h1>
      <section className="textPage">
      
        <p>This web app that you surely loved is an experimental project made by <a href="https://twitter.com/itsvitoracacio" target="blank">Vitor</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/edulopeso" target="blank">Eduardo</a>.</p>

        <p>We're both software engineers and long time friends. This Built this site as an exercise, since we’ve been studying web development for the last few months and wanted to entertain you. Vitor, who had the idea for the project and headed us through the processes, chose to make it about the GRAMMYs because of his love for music (mostly rap music but also music in general).</p>

        <p>The technologies used for this site are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and, of course, lots of love (which is the hardest of them to learn). The idea was to create an app that could not only make us exercise and review the things we learned but also push us to explore things we didn’t know yet. We found out that we could train our developers muscles building an app that would help people getting to know new artists, listening to good music, exploring the GRAMMY Awards’ categories, while browsing an immersive, funny and incredibly beautiful website.</p>

        <p>We hope you liked it. Make sure to follow us for updates about new projects and to see us complain about the things we’re studying, get in touch if you have any suggestions.</p>

        <p>See ya.</p>
